### Firebase Configuration

HomeKeep is already configured to use a Firebase instance by default, but if you want to 
use your own custom firebase: 

### Custom Firebase for Frontend

You can replace the config in js/firebase-config.js.

### Cloud Functions

HomeKeep uses Firebase Cloud Functions to manage the notification backend. It interacts with NotificationAPI to trigger the sending of notifications for tasks. To use the Cloud Functions, you will need to set up an account with [NotificationAPI](https://www.notificationapi.com/). Once you are logged in, you'll need to:

- Create a new notification
- Configure it to use email as the channel.
- Design the notification using the template in the NotificationAPI interface.
- After setup, you'll receive a clientID and clientSecret.
- Replace 'your_client_id' and 'your_client_secret' with your NotificationAPI credentials in the provided cloud function.

The functions can be found in CloudAPI.

```
cd CloudAPI
firebase login
firebase use 
```

After you perform firebase use, select your project from the list.

```
firebase deploy --only functions
```
