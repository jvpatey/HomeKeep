HomeKeep is a user-friendly web application designed to help you manage and track your home maintenance tasks efficiently.
To start, you need to create a user account, allowing you to add maintenance tasks to a Firestore database and set notifications based on your chosen frequency and start date.

You can view tasks in two formats: a detailed table that shows all scheduled maintenance tasks and a calendar view for a more visual representation of your maintenance schedule. 
HomeKeep's flexible cloud-based notification system ensures you receive timely reminders via email on the day your task is due.
